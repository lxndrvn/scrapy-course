We are seeking a unique person to help run our construction department.,

We are a single family real estate company.  Our HQ is in Manhattan but our projects are in various cities in the Southeast.    We buy distressed SFR on the courthouse steps or through off-market deals, rehab the houses and either sell retail as 'flips' or keep for our rental portfolio.   In 2017, we had 90 closings and in 2018, we already have over 50 houses in inventory, so we should do around 150 to 200 closings.  Also, we sometimes build single family from the ground up (around 30 new construction closings in 2017).  ,
,
FYI, We have more of a tech startup culture than a stereotypical real estate culture.  We are fairly laid back but only hire people who are team players.,

Your job is to remotely manage our projects from our office in Midtown.  ,

, ,SUPERSTRUCTURES Engineers + Architects, , ,New York City's leading professional firm dedicated to the preservation of buildings and infrastructure is seeking a recent graduate with an architecture or structural engineering degree and an interest in preservation of buildings and infrastructure., 

SUPERSTRUCTURES works on an array of challenging projects on many of New York's most prominent buildings. We've won frequent awards, as well as the loyalty of some of the premier clients in the region -- public, corporate and residential.  Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure - facades, roofs, windows, and plazas - and the full complement of materials, from landmark terra cotta to high performance curtain walls. , 

We work in teams. Teams are assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a ""small office experience"" coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state of the art non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques. , 

Employees typically participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see the designs you draw executed in the field, and you'll take on greater responsibility and client exposure as soon as you are ready. , 

Frequent lunchtime seminars by industry experts, including our own in-house personnel, keep us current on developments in the profession (with the additional benefit of a free lunch). , 

SUPERSTRUCTURES offers top-level compensation for top-level people, and the advancement potential of a thriving company. , 

We are committed to a work / life balance, and to a work week of 40 hours.  When, on occasion, more than 40 hours are required, our employees are compensated for every additional hour worked. 
Our benefits include paid holidays, vacation and sick days, health insurance for employee and family, 401(k) with automatic employer contribution, a continuing education allowance, and free NYC Transit MetroCards. , 

Our light-filled office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and drop dead views in three directions - not a bad place to spend the workday., 

Our Tribeca location is one of New York City's most convenient and vibrant, easily accessible via public transportation. The A, C, and E subway lines stop right in the building. The N, R, #1, and #6 lines are each just a few blocks away.,
